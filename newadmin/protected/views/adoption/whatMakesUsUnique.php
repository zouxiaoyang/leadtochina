      <h2>What Makes Us Unique?</h2>
           <p>
              Six years ago, we organized the first return trip for an US adoptive family. After the discussion, we noticed that adoptees homeland tours are differed from other traditional China tours. All questions should be taken into consideration that how to take adoptive families to visit most beautiful places, taste most typical food in China, appreciate Chinese history and culture, and experience the Chinese local life during the travel. Now, you will find all the answers from our tours &amp; arrangement.</p>
              <p><strong>1.legitimate Travel Company, with Years of Homeland Tour Arrangement Experience</strong><br>
              Established in 2008, Hefei Full View Travel Company (Simplified Chinese:畅景, Pinyin: chang jing) is an International Travel Service Co., Ltd ratified by China National Tourism and Hefei Industry and Commerce Administration. It is a qualified tour operator to run the business mainly for overseas tourists travelling in China and Chinese inbound travel. </p>
              <p><strong>2.Original Understanding to Homeland Tour: Not Another tour company in China, but Chinese friends</strong><br>
              We are not that kind of travel company only sells China travel service. We care more about your feeling and your impression to China and its people. We always remind ourselves that in some fields we represent our country and good character of Chinese, and we want to be the one in China you can trust and willing to contact with, the one you like to send mails and say "Hi", the one you call "China Friend".</p>  
              <p><strong>3. Our Homeland Tour Network</strong><br>
              We have our own Homeland tour network to make sure that every stop of your homeland tour goes smoothly. We do have long-term cooperation with our local travel compaines who is specialized in China Homeland tour. Meanwhile, some of them are designated travel companies by provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which means tour quality is guaranteed.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Good Relations with Department of Civil Affairs</strong><br>
              Visiting SWI must have approval from Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, and Lead to China has never failed in applying for it since 2010. If SWI can find the nurse and foster family of your child, they will arrange the meeting in the SWI for you definitely. You even can visit the Provincial center of adoption service in some provinces.</p> 
              <p><strong>5. Professional Guides</strong><br>
              This is the most important part during your whole tour. We will offer professional guides with fluent English and over 5 years' experience. In order to offer better tour services for our clients, we supervise guides strictly. The guides can not ask for tips or force clients to buy from tourist shops. When tour ends, our clients will receive our "feedback envelop" and you can rate our services there. We will undertake regular centralized training or weed out guides who receive bad reviews.</p> 
            
              <p><strong>6. Top Destinations for first-time China Return Trip</strong><br>

</p>
              <p><strong>7. Deluxe Accommodation</strong><br>
              According to our experience and former customers' feedback, we are offering the best 4 – star hotels for adoptee trips. Due to the difference of accommodation standard between Occident and China, three star hotels cannot satisfy your requirement of comfort, while the five star hotels cost too much. So, four star hotels are the most proper choice for foreign travelers. For a journey around two weeks, you have some free time in the evening. Therefore, the location of hotels is quite important. We will offer hotels located in commercial city center so that you will find places to eat, shop and short excursion very easily. Meanwhile, staffs in Chinese four star hotels are fluent in communication with travelers in English.</p> 
              <p><strong>8. Special Activities</strong><br>
              We find out that children from adoptive families are mostly of 8~13 years old. In this age of children may lack of patience to follow guide's whole explanations. They want more involved and interactional activities. We prepare special activities for children: such as local family visit in Hutongs, learning to make dumplings, evening acrobatic show in Beijing, bicycle riding on Xian Ancient City Wall, China Panda Base Visit in Chengdu, learning Chinese cuisine, landscape painting in Guilin. Interchange activities including local school visit, Chinese learning will be arranged in our tour.</p> 
              <p><strong>9. Orphanage Visit</strong><br>
              Everyone knows the meaning of homeland tour while the orphanage visit is the most important things for adoptee children. Based in China, we have built very strong professional relationships with officials at all levels in China. We can offer almost all China orphanages visit.</p> 
              <p><strong>10. Keep Improving</strong><br>
              Our listed services may not be the perfect. Different family has different need. However, we are always making efforts to offer higher quality and value-added China return tours for adoptive families. Any helpful suggestions which will improve our service will be warmly welcomed. We will try our best to keep improving.</p>
