Generally speaking, you will arrive at the city where the SWI located one day in advance, and have one whole next day to visit SWI, and recall the good time your kid spent here with the nurse and director of the SWI. </p>

       <p class="Know_cont1_txt3"><span class="Know_cont1_txt1">2. Visit SWI</span><BR />
The Director of the SWI will show you around the SWI, such as the children's activity room, library, bedroom, recreation room, dining hall. Your tour guide is your interpreter, and he/she will help you to find out your concerns.</p>

The SWI will inform them your coming and arrange the meeting in SWI if they could find the nurse and the foster family. You know, some left and even moved to other city, so we cannot guarantee that we will find them certainly. It depends on the response from SWI.</p>

Based on 捡拾弃婴（儿童）情况证明(a file shows where your child was found and who can prove it), your tour guide will accompany you to that area to have a look. Sometimes, life is a miracle and time is the only thing to witness it. One night many years ago, a helpless infant was crying in a little quilt and hoping for a warm embrace from his/her parents, Who would have guessed that the warm embrace comes from a far away country on the opposite side of the continent years later. Thanks God.</p>
