      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">Since the mid-20th century, the number of Beijing hutongs has dropped dramatically as they are demolished to make way for new roads and buildings.

    <div class="Activ_cont1_mid">
      <div class="Activ_cont1_mid_txt">
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">You are going to make dumplings in an ordinary Beijing people family and share the happiness of them.<br />
All ingredients are prepared, you can make the dumplings with the help of the host. Of course, then you will taste the dumplings you made to check your skill.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">Dumplings are one of the Chinese people's favorite traditional dishes. To Chinese people who show high reverence for family love, having dumplings at the moment the old year is replaced by the new is an essential part of bidding farewell to the old and ushering in the new year.And then let us know how to make it.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">According to an ancient Chinese legend, dumplings were first made by the medical saint---Zhang Zhongjing. There are three steps involved in making dumplings: 1) make dumpling wrappers out of dumpling flour（擀皮ɡǎnpí）; 2) prepare the dumpling stuffing; 3) make dumplings and boil them. With thin and elastic dough skin, fresh and tender stuffing, delicious taste, and unique shapes, dumplings are worth eating hundreds of times. There’s an old saying that claims(俗语súyǔ), “Nothing could be more delicious than dumplings”. During the Spring Festival and other holidays, or when treating relatives and friends, Chinese people like to follow the auspicious custom of eating dumplings.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">First of all,pour some water into the wheat flour,and stir it until it becomes a piece of dough,you can put three egg whites in the 250g flour, it may cause the stuffed dumpling skin nicely chewy skidding. after that then put them for 20 minutes to "awake the dough".also get some filling ready.it can be vegetables or meat.Certainly remember must put the oil before put the salt, in such vegetable moisture not easily is killed by the salt…After,put the ingredient such as spice,onion and ginger to stir evenly on is OK.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">Then cut the large ipece of dough into many small pieces,roll the dough with a rolling pin into round,thin wrappers.Put the filling in the center of a wrappper,and fold it up.</p>
      
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">The last thing to do is to boil them, When the water is boiling, put the dumplings one by one into the water and cover the pot. When steam comes out, add more cold water and when it boils again add cold water a second time. When you see the dumplings floating in boiling water, you can put them in bowls or plates, get the chopsticks and be ready to eat.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">In northern China,dumplings are dipped（蘸zhàn） in vinegar and soy sauce and often eaten with a piece of raw garlic.</p>

      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">Tai chi, which originated in China as a martial art, is a mind-body practice in complementary and alternative medicine. Tai chi is sometimes referred to as "moving meditation"—practitioners move their bodies slowly, gently, and with awareness, while breathing deeply. This Backgrounder provides a general overview of tai chi and suggests sources for additional information. It incorporates the Chinese concepts of yin and yang (opposing forces within the body) and qi (a vital energy or life force). Practicing tai chi is said to support a healthy balance of yin and yang, thereby aiding the flow of qi. </p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">People practice tai chi by themselves or in groups. In the Chinese community, people commonly practice tai chi in nearby parks—often in early morning before going to work. There are many different styles, but all involve slow, relaxed, graceful movements, each flowing into the next. The body is in constant motion, and posture is important. The names of some of the movements evoke nature (e.g., "Embrace Tiger, Return to Mountain"). Individuals practicing tai chi must also concentrate, putting aside distracting thoughts; and they must breathe in a deep and relaxed, but focused manner.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">As the origin of the Tai Chi Kungfu, there is a popular legend crediting it to Chang San-Feng, a Taoist monk, who developed a set of 13 exercises that imitate the movements of animals, and the meditation and the concept of internal force. According to the history, it started as a martial art and a means of self-defence. In the early Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), a martial artist named Chen Bo immigrate to Chenjiagou village, Wen County Henan province from Shanxi Province. For protecting village against bandits, Chen bo sets up a martial arts organization and taught martial arts. Slowly, Chen invented the Tai Chi Kungfu and his disciples spread it to whole China and then the world. While entering Zhaobao Town, you will find you are in Tai Chi Culture Holy land. Here has Chen Bo Tai Chi master Memorial Hall, world known China's Tai Chi Museum and numerous Tai Chi training schools.  </p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">In 1982, Wen County is entitled as "Class A Open County" by the State Council, first batch "Wushu Hometwon" by National Sports Commission in 1992; State-level non-material cultural heritage by the State Council in 2006; "China Tai Chi Quan Birthplace" by Chinese Wushu Association in 2007; "The Hometown of Wushu with the most concern from global Netizen" with Defeng City Henan Province, Cangzhou City Hebei Province in 2011. </p>

      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt"><span class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt1">[ Traditional Chinese Paintings ]</span><br />
With a history of over 6,000 years, it is belived the earliest Chinese paintings should be the inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells of the Shang Dynasty. There are words, but have vivid image. Then should be the colored pottery with painted human faces, fish, deer and frogs in the Neolithic Age. Over the centuries, the growth of Chinese painting reflected the change of time and social conditions. Traditional Chinese painting has its special materials and tools, consisting of brushes, ink and pigments, xuan paper, silk and various kinds of ink slabs. There are also other divisions based on different classification standards.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta"><span class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt1">[ Techniques ]</span><br />
According to painting techniques, Chinese painting can be divided into two styles: xieyi style and gongbi style. Xieyi, or freehand, is marked by exaggerated forms and freehand brushwork. Gongbi, or meticulous, is characterized by close attention to detail and fine brushwork. Freehand painting generalizes shapes and displays rich brushwork and ink techniques</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt"><span class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt1">[ Forms ]</span><br />
The principal forms of traditional Chinese painting are the hanging scroll, album of paintings, fan surface and long horizontal scroll. Hanging scrolls can be both horizontal and vertical, usually mounted and hung on the wall. In an album of paintings the artist paints on a certain size of xuan paper and then binds a number of paintings into an album, which is convenient for storage. Folding fans and round fans are made of bamboo strips with painted paper or silk pasted on the frame. The long, horizontal scroll is also called a hand scroll and is usually less than 50 centimeters high but may be more than 100 meters long.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt"><span class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt1">[ Subjects ]</span><br />
Traditional Chinese paintings can be classified as figure paintings, landscapes and flower-and-bird paintings. Landscapes represent a major category in traditional Chinese painting, mainly depicting the natural scenery of mountains and rivers. superficially, traditional Chinese paintings can be divided into three categories, in fact, each one of the three categories reflect its concept and idea about universe and life.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">Figure paintings reflect the relationship between human society, and people to people; Landscape paintings reflect the relationship between people and nature; the flower-and-bird paintings reflect the harmonious living environment between all kinds of life in nature and people.These categories are the philosophical reflection on arts, the essence of China's art.</p>

Yangshuo county covers an area of 1,428 square km and has 20,000 hectares of land used for agricultural cultivation. It has a population about 300,000, making up of different ethnic groups such as Han, Zhuang, Yao, Hui, etc.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">As the old saying goes, "Guilin's scenery is the most beautiful in the world, Yangshuo's scenery is far more superior to that of Guilin's". In Yangshuo County alone, there are over 20,000 hill and over 250 scenic spits. The clean Li River winds through Yangshuo for 56km. magical peaks and push green bamboo trees lie on both sides of the river. There are plenty of nice scenic spots, such as Nine-Horse Painted Hill, Yellow Reflection Point, Xingping Village, Lotus Cave, Young Scholar Hill, Snow Lion Ridge, the Big Banyan Tree, Moon Hill, and Dragon River. Besides, amongst the mountains and waters are old buildings and old bridges that reflect the rich cultural heritage of Yangshuo.  </p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">Cycling is a great idea and the easiest way to get around in the area of Yangshuo to see some of the spectacular landscapes. The paths in and out villages are not practical for car and a little bit far for walking. Besides, most of the routes are flat enough - with only very small hills. Those who take mountain bikes with a range of gears will hardly even notice the hills that are there. There are two ways to start cycling around. You can tour the nearby area with the help of the cycling map offered by bike renter or get a local guide from them. If you have limited time, a guide is worth. </p>
