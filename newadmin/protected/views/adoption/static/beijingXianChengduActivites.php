    <div class="Activ_cont1_mid">
      <div class="Activ_cont1_mid_txt">
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">You are going to make dumplings in an ordinary Beijing people family and share the happiness of them.<br />
All ingredients are prepared, you can make the dumplings with the help of the host. Of course, then you will taste the dumplings you made to check your skill.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">Dumplings are one of the Chinese people's favorite traditional dishes. To Chinese people who show high reverence for family love, having dumplings at the moment the old year is replaced by the new is an essential part of bidding farewell to the old and ushering in the new year.And then let us know how to make it.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">According to an ancient Chinese legend, dumplings were first made by the medical saint---Zhang Zhongjing. There are three steps involved in making dumplings: 1) make dumpling wrappers out of dumpling flour（擀皮ɡǎnpí）; 2) prepare the dumpling stuffing; 3) make dumplings and boil them. With thin and elastic dough skin, fresh and tender stuffing, delicious taste, and unique shapes, dumplings are worth eating hundreds of times. There’s an old saying that claims(俗语súyǔ), “Nothing could be more delicious than dumplings”. During the Spring Festival and other holidays, or when treating relatives and friends, Chinese people like to follow the auspicious custom of eating dumplings.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">First of all,pour some water into the wheat flour,and stir it until it becomes a piece of dough,you can put three egg whites in the 250g flour, it may cause the stuffed dumpling skin nicely chewy skidding. after that then put them for 20 minutes to "awake the dough".also get some filling ready.it can be vegetables or meat.Certainly remember must put the oil before put the salt, in such vegetable moisture not easily is killed by the salt…After,put the ingredient such as spice,onion and ginger to stir evenly on is OK.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txta">Then cut the large ipece of dough into many small pieces,roll the dough with a rolling pin into round,thin wrappers.Put the filling in the center of a wrappper,and fold it up.</p>
      
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">The last thing to do is to boil them, When the water is boiling, put the dumplings one by one into the water and cover the pot. When steam comes out, add more cold water and when it boils again add cold water a second time. When you see the dumplings floating in boiling water, you can put them in bowls or plates, get the chopsticks and be ready to eat.</p>
      <p class="adoptionIti_cont1_txt">In northern China,dumplings are dipped（蘸zhàn） in vinegar and soy sauce and often eaten with a piece of raw garlic.</p>
