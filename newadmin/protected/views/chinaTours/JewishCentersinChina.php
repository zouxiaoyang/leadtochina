    <p class="stu_midtxt_lef2" style="padding-top:5px;">Jewish settlers are documented as early as the 7th or 8th AD, most notably known as the Kaifeng China Jews. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish merchants from around the world began to trade in Chinese ports, particularly in the commercial centers of Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Harbin. In the first half of the 20th century, thousands of Jewish refugees escaping from the 1917 Russian Revolution, and over 20,000 Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany arrived in Harbin, Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>

    <p class="jew_content1_lef">The first major wave of Jews, primarily from Baghdad and Bombay, came to Shanghai after the city was opened to foreign traders in 1842 following the Opium War since the Qing Dynasty lost the battle and the British opened a concession in Shanghai. A second wave of Jewish immigrants came from Russia in the decades following the 1917 Russian Revolution. The third wave of Jews moved to Shanghai from central Europe in the 1930s and during WWII. The stream of Jewish refugees increased after Kristallnacht and became a flood in 1939. By 1941, about twenty thousand refugees from Germany, Austria, and Poland had arrived in Shanghai. From 1933 to 1941, this city accepted about 30,000 Jewish refugees coming from Europe, more refugees than those taken in by Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India combined during World War II</p>

    <p>During the World War II, as the Nazi Empire sent shock waves to the Jewish community in Germany, many abandoned their belongings and fled to China for safety since Shanghai was an open port: no visas or passports were required. Life was difficult in Shanghai, but better than anything they had left behind. There was always food, always something to eat, always shelter even when the Jewish community was ghettoized shortly after Pearl Harbor.</p>
    <p>"Shanghai was a multiethnic city and the Japanese controlled the city's Chinese populations. There were elite Sephardic Jews from Iraq, Syria and other parts of the Middle East who had long lived and prospered in Shanghai, as well as the new immigrants from Germany. They were later to be joined by Jews from Lithuania and Poland. The British ruled the International Settlement. The more comfortable Jews had built a community in Shanghai replete with synagogues and schools ..." From p. xvi - Strange Haven: A Jewish Childhood in Wartime Shanghai by Sigmund Tobias</p>
    <p>From the 1930s, approximately 20,000 refugees escaped the destruction wrought by the Nazis while leaving behind their memories of life, traumas and experiences of war. However, as history reveals itself, Shanghai was suddenly under attack and occupation by the Japanese. The Japanese forces relocated Jews to live in their own ghettos known as the Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees (or Shanghai Ghetto) where many were cramped into tiny living spaces, and starved but not deprived of food. In this setting, the Japanese permitted a bit more flexibility for the Jewish communities compared to the Nazis. However, both were still ruthless empires of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>Once the war ended in 1945, the ghettos were officially liberated; a few stayed in Shanghai while a majority migrated to the newly established state called Israel in 1948. The museum, located at 62 Changyang Road, Hongkou District, consists of two parts: the former site of Ohel Moshe Synagogue and the gallery. It is an important component of the "Tilanqiao Historic Area" and serves as a witness commemorating the phase of history when the Jewish refugees lived in Shanghai.</p>

    <p class="jew_content1_lef">In the late years of the Qing Dynasty, the Russia was granted the concession to build the Chinese Eastern Railway under the Russo-Manchurian treaty of 1898, and Harbin became its administrative center with a 30-mi. (50 km.)-wide zone along the railway. Since the czarist government was interested in speedily populating the area and granted to Jews a better status than that of the Jews in Russia and plots of land on the outskirts of the town, many Jews immigrated to Harbin and formed the first Jewish community. After the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, many demobilized Jewish soldiers settled in Harbin, followed by refugees from the 1905 - 07 pogroms. By 1908 there were 8,000 Jews in the city, and a central synagogue was built in 1909. </p>

    <p>Later, the Jewish refugees during the World War I, the Russian Revolution (1917), and the Russian civil war sharply increased the Jewish community, which reached its peak-10,000-15,000. In the years from 1924 to 1931,  since the new born Soviet regime was preoccupied with internal problems, the Jews of Harbin were left alone to prosper. However, the Chinese Eastern Railway was handed over to Japanese in 1934 for the Soviet Union wanted to enhance the western battlefronts. Many Jews left Harbin, some to the Soviet Union, others to Shanghai, Tianjin and so on.</p>
    <p>Later, many Jews left China before the outbreak of World War II, to the U.S, Australia, Brazil, and other countries. During the World War II, The treatment of Jews became even more oppressive when the Japanese allied with Nazi Germany. During 1945 - 47, Harbin was under Soviet occupation, and Jewish community leaders were then arrested and sent to the Soviet interior. About 3,500 of the former "Chinese" Jews, most of them from Harbin, live in Israel, where they play an active role in all walks of life.

    <p class="jew_content1_lef">China's only city where there are Chinese Jews. A thousand years ago, it was an emperor of Northern Song Dynasty that allowed those Jews fleeing from the persecucation by persians to settle down in Kaifeng. Still today descendants of these Jews are so grateful to China. Every year, hundreds of Jewish tourists coming from different places in the world come to visit Kaifeng Jewish Community. Mainly Jewish sites in Kaifeng include the Mini-Jewish Museum about Kaifeng Jewry, site of former Kaifeng synagogue, the mikvah of Kaifeng Jewish community and south teaching torah lane and north teaching torah lane, that were the chinese jews' living quarter in the past. Apart from the sites, the nearby muslim community with different mosques are also nice places to know local people and construction.</p>
