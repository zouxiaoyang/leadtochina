If so, they came soon after the founding of Islam by Mohamed in what is now Saudi Arabia about the year 600 AD. They came soon after his death. This is about 16 years after a Nestorian Christian missionary named Alopun went to Chang An. Islam arrived after Buddhism and Christianity. Muslim traders began to arrive in China during the Tang Empire, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of Muslims were brought to the Mongol Yuan Empire by the Mongols who used them to govern and administrate China, and many of the Mongols themselves became Muslims. The religion spread quickly in Central Asia by Muslim conquest of the nomadic tribes and empires between Arabia and China. Later, many small ethnic groups that are in western, northern, and southeastern China such as the Uighurs, Kazakhs, and Tajiks became Muslim.</p>

This was second church differentiation of Chinese Islam since the afferent Sufis in late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty. After the two differentiation, there formed the modern Chinese Islam structure.</p>
